# Objectifying-Image-Enhancement-Techniques-through-ML-technique

The project uses clustering to objectify the process of Image Enhancement and propose a set of techniques for image enhancement. A total of 7 techniques have been taken for consideration.

The conclusion of study is included in the report.


The project is broadly done in two steps:

i) Clustering of images is carrie out based on histograms of the images as a feature array.

ii) Then for each cluster 2 or 3 best suited image enhacenment technique is suggested.
